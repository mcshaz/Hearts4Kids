            <h2>The Need</h2>

            <p>
                The Starship Paediatric Cardiac Unit
                has a long history of service to Pacific Island children with either congenital
                defects or acquired rheumatic valve disease. In the last decade the number of
                regular outreach clinics has markedly increased creating productive links
                between the specialists in Starship and local paediatricians in Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu,
                the Solomons, Tuvalu and Fiji. Echocardiograms can now be performed overseas
                and transmitted electronically to Auckland to help diagnosis and allow our
                cardiologists to advise on management.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a unit we have been open to
                accepting patients for operation with simple defects or valve problems, but 
                <strong>
                    in reality many
                    of these babies and children do not make it safely to Auckland for surgery
                </strong>. The
                reasons for this include:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        limited funding from charity and government sources ($NZ 45 000
                        for each open heart repair)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Limited ability of a family member to accompany the child and get a visa, or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Processing delays, which are often accompanied by a significant
                        deterioration in the child’s condition - thus preventing travel or increasing
                        the operating costs to a prohibitive level.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            <p>
                On average about 30 operations per
                year are performed in Auckland on Pacific Island children.

                The population of Fiji, Solomon
                Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Tuvalu and Kiribati is collectively 2.2 million
                and the average birth rate is 23 births per 1000 per year. This equates to
                50,000 births, and thus about 350 infants born with congenital heart defects
                each year.There are also many more who develop rheumatic heart disease  (which
                forms at least a third of the current cases referred). Some children make it to
                India and Australia, but there are many children who do not access surgery, yet
                have heart defects which are completely curable with a single operation.

                Heart operations range from
                simple to complex, curable to palliative. In the congenital heart field there
                are a number of operations that are reasonably simple and yet provide a
                life-saving cure with little or no specialist follow-up. With careful attention
                to case selection, planning and surgical repair, quality of life afterwards is usually
                excellent. Knowing the huge need, an expatriate Fijian and adult cardiac surgeon,
                Dr Parma Nand  established the <a href="http://friends-of-fiji-heart-foundation.org.nz/">

                with heart disease for the past 10 years.

                @Html.ActionLink("Kirsten Finucane", "Team", new { name = "Kirsten Finucane" }) visited
                paediatricians and health officials at Suva and Lautoka to discuss how to
                improve care for children in Fiji with heart conditions. The Fijian paediatricians
                explained there was a real need for:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More clinics, provided by an experienced heart specialist.</li>
                    <li>
                        A visiting cardiac surgical program for children. <a href="http://www.ohi.org.au/">Open Heart International</a> had been, and
                        continues to provide one vital cardiac surgical program annually; unfortunately,
                        this program was unable to single-handedly meet the need for cardiac surgery in
                        children. Furthermore, by spacing the two programs, some children could be
                        given a curative operation that would have died while waiting 12 months for the
                        team to return.

                In September
                2013 John Wright and Kirsten Finucane revisited Lautoka Hospital, whilst the
                FOFHF adult mission was in progress. They determined that the environment would
                allow paediatric cardiac surgery to take place safely, when accompanied by
                careful planning and case selection.

                FOFHF program. With careful planning and funding estimated at NZ$50 000, a team
                of 24 professionals who were willing to donate their holidays (and many pay for
                their own flights and accommodation) were identified.

            <p>
                In September of 2014, we undertook
                our inaugural program. Using the equipment shipped to Lautoka by FOFHF and financed
                by FOFHF, we performed heart surgery on 12 patients over 4 days. The youngest
                was 5 weeks of age and all patients survived and were discharged home safe and
                well. Follow up by our team members and communication with Fijian medical staff
                has confirmed that all 12 have been ‘cured’ and should now have a normal life
                expectancy and function. Of course, we look forward to reviewing them on our
                yearly visits to confirm the great outcomes. The 12 operations were performed
                at a cost of NZ$60,000 which is around 15% of the equivalent cost if brought to
                NZ for surgery (See stories).

            <h2>Our current situation</h2>

            <p>
                After the success of 2014 we are
                keen to repeat the surgical outreach visit, but funding for 2015 has become a
                problem and FOFHF are not in a financial position to be able to fund our program on their own.
                They continue to support us logistically and we will continue to use the equipment
                shipped for adult surgery but we need to fund many other costs, examples of
                which can be seen on our <a href="http://hearts4kids.org.nz/Home/Donate">donations page</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of our future aims is to
                transport children from other Pacific Islands to Fiji for this much lower cost
                surgery - an aim shared by the Fijian paediatricians, who already accept
                transfer of children for other subspecialty care, from the Pacific Islands.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Hearts 4 Kids Trust has
                been established in order to fund the costs associated with providing an annual
                cardiac surgical program to Fiji, to operate on Pacific Island children with heart
                disease. The repair of simple congenital heart defects is one of the most lifesaving
                and cost-effective operations to be done in the field of medicine today.

                We plan on rolling out even more structured and informal teaching programs for the Fijian staff over the coming years. This increasing skill set will
                undoubtedly improve care for Fijians requiring hospitalisation after the team has left. This includes general principles not just applicable to children with heart disease, but to all critically unwell patients.

                    All time required to establish and administer our
                    trust (and of course time spent by the clinical team caring for the children) has
                    been provided free. Running costs such as website design and hosting are donated
                    for by team members. Your money goes exclusively to the care of children
                    requiring heart surgery, and none to administration or marketing costs.

                    The trustees, team members and support
                    crew are committed to running this trust as efficiently as possible, with the
                    best outcomes possible for the children on the most frugal budget we can.

                    We'll keep you updated on how our cildren are doing, and hope you are a little touched by the

                Our team consists of some of the
                most experienced nurses and doctors in Starship heart unit, and we enjoy the
                privilege of using our skills and giving up our time to reach some of the
                poorest children in the world and change their lives. These are people who know
                that without our help, the future was dire - the smiles on the faces of the
                children and family as the children recover and the tearful hugs of thanks as we
                leave make the team want to continue helping.
