            <p class="lead">The repair of simple congenital heart defects is one of the most lifesaving and cost-effective operations to be done in the field of medicine today.</p>
            <p>Led by surgeon Kirsten Finucane, the medical team consists of some of the most experienced nurses and doctors in Starship’s Heart Unit.</p>
            <p>The medical team volunteer their time, giving up at least a week’s holiday to travel to Fiji and work to help as many babies and children as time and resources will allow.</p>
            <p>Last year in just 4 days, 12 children were operated on and cared for at a cost of NZ$70,000, just 15% of the equivalent cost if the same children were brought to New Zealand for surgery. (Open heart repair of a child flown from the Pacific Islands to Auckland costs $45,000).</p>
            <p>This year the medical team of 24 surgeons, cardiologists, intensive care nurses, anaesthetists and profusionists need $85,000 to travel to Fiji to operate on and care for XX babies and children. </p>

        <h3><a id="background-link">Background</a></h3>
        <p>The Starship Paediatric Cardiac Unit has a long history of service to Pacific Island children with either congenital defects or acquired rheumatic valve disease. In the last decade the number of regular outreach clinics has markedly increased creating links between the specialists in Starship and local paediatricians in Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, the Solomons, Tuvalu and Fiji.</p>
        <p>Of a collective population of 2.2million people, there are 350 children born with congenital heart defects each year across the Pacific Islands of Fiji, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, Tuvalu and Kiribati. In addition there are also many more diagnosed with rheumatic valve disease, which forms at least a third of the current cases referred. </p>
        <p>The Unit performs 30 operations per year in Auckland on Pacific Island children with simple defects or valve problems. But, many other babies and children are not able to get safely to Auckland for surgery – due to funding shortfalls, visa and processing delays of family members. Although we know a few children are referred to Australia and India there are many children who do not access surgery yet have curable heart defects. </p>
        <p>Hearts4Kids also hopes to empower the local medical and nursing staff to detect and care for babies from birth or time of diagnosis. As the organisation further develops its relationships with the local community Hearts4Kids will develop the local facilities and educate the local staff. This would create sustainability for future visits as the more medical and nursing staff become up skilled in this field, the less team members we need to take with us. Skills learnt in this area of medicine will also undoubtedly result in improved outcomes for other children requiring complex care in the hospital. </p>

                <p>Kirsten is the Head of Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery at Starship and Auckland Hospitals, the only unit in New Zealand to perform children's heart operations. She has 19 years of experience as a cardiothoracic consultant and has led the team for 15 of those years. The unit in New Zealand performs over 400 major operations per year, many on infants under a year of age, with results comparable to those of the best centres in USA or Europe.</p>
                <p>An experience working in a missionary hospital in Nepal in 1984 and seeing the huge positive impact of good operations on their sick, was her initial catalyst for deciding to train as a surgeon.</p>
                <p>One of Kirsten's major interests has been repairing the valves of children affected by rheumatic heart disease, for which she has several publications, and these operations on over 150 children have included many from the Pacific Islands brought to New Zealand for treatment.</p>
                <p>Kirsten is mum to 3 boys, and lives in Auckland with her partner, <a href="#JohnWright">John Wright</a>. In 2009 Kirsten received the New Zealand Order of Merit in recognition of her dedicated national service and international reputation in the field of paediatric cardiac surgery.</p>

                <p>John Wright is a paediatric cardiologist who trained in Medicine at Cambridge University and after various junior posts, developed his career in Birmingham Children's cardiac unit working for over 20 years in the unit with the best outcomes in the UK in particular for complex neonatal surgery. The son of Sir Oliver Wright, a well known British diplomat, he spent his childhood years moving from country to country and thus has always had a love of travelling and learning about different cultures. Over the last 25 years he has volunteered on a variety of surgical missions to support local services or support surgeons visiting to operate where the countries do not have access to services, including East Jerusalem, Malaysia, and India. </p>
                <p>In 2009 John came to NZ to do a locum and stayed permanently, to become a member of the Starship cardiology team. He was interested in the visits of his colleagues to Tonga, Samoa, and Vanuatu for clinics. A friend on the golf course who is an expatriot from near Lautoka, Fiji, persuaded him to consider visiting Fiji and look at how services to heart children could be improved there, and the ideas for this project were born!</p>
                <p>He lives with Kirsten and enjoys walking the dogs, playing golf and supporting the All Blacks and the Black caps (unless they are playing England).</p>

                <p>As a surgical nurse assistant, Helen’s main role is to first assist the surgeon at the operations.  Her technical expertise and knowledge allow the operation to be done safely but at speed, which is important for good outcomes in this specialty. The role is more comprehensive than operating alone as it involves both preoperative checks to ensure all the information is available for each patient on the operating table, and postoperative care alongside the medical staff in the wards. </p>
                <p>Helen has a long background of nursing experience in the cardiothoracic field having worked at Greenlane and the Ascot Cardiac theatres. She came to the Starship unit as paediatric first assistant in 2011. </p>
                <p>Through 2008 to 2013 Helen joined the adult operating team going to Lautoka, Fiji four times to perform cardiac surgery and travelled to Zambia with another team. Last year, Helen coordinated the first paediatric visit to operate in Lautoka, Fiji and enabled the team to perform 12 operations safely and with the resources needed. </p>
                <p>Helen grew up in Auckland and lives with her husband and three boys in Meadowbank. She is a keen boatie and enjoys being out on the harbour and out of range of the phone!  </p>

                <p>Carol Robinson leads the intensive care nursing team, recruiting and organising the group of senior nurses who look after the infants and children in the first few hours after surgery. </p>
                <p>Carol has been to Fiji four times with the adult team and last year with the first paediatric visit. Her role includes creating inventories of the equipment and drugs required as absolutely everything needs to be brought from New Zealand to recreate an intensive care environment within the basic facilities of the local hospital.</p>
                <p>Carol's parents were farmers and she was brought up in the Bay of Islands where the serious impact of poverty and poor health on people's quality of life was a reality in her day to day life. She has had a long career in cardiac intensive care nursing, first at Greenlane, and then at Starship Hospital. </p>
                <p>Her passion is in the area of education, and she currently holds the portfolio for Cardiac Education in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at Starship. Since going to Fiji she has been actively working to upskill the nurses there by direct teaching sessions during the visits, by including local nurses on the rostered shifts to work alongside our nurses, and by providing certificates that acknowledge the local nurses involvement and skills obtained at the end of the visit. </p>
                <p>In 2015 Carol plans to implement an educational programme that she has now developed specifically for Fijian nurses to improve their knowledge and skills in paediatric intensive care, which will have a year-round impact on the quality of care for all children admitted there with critical health problems, not just cardiac.</p>
                <p>Carol lives out west with her partner and two adult children and loves tramping, gardening and watching absolutely any sport on TV. </p>
                <p>She has taken great pleasure in seeing young adult patients from earlier missions return to tell her just what a huge change the surgery has made in their lives. </p>
