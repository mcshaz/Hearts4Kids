            <p>Each year in the Pacific, 350<sup>*</sup> children are born with congenital heart disease.</p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, they have limited access to life saving surgery.
            </p>

            <p>
                With your help these children have the opportunity to lead active and fulfilling lives.
            </p>

            <p>Please support the volunteer team at Hearts4Kids who hope to visit Fiji in September 2015.</p>
